For each subinterval, we can apply the [midpoint rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpoint_rule) to integrate a function $f$:\n",

At angle $\\varphi = 0$, rays are parallel to the Y axis ($\\theta(0) = (0, 1)$), the detector coordinate increases along the +X axis ($\\theta^\\perp(0) = (1, 0)$), and for increasing $\\varphi$, this right-hand system performs a counter-clockwise rotation.\n",
