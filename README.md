# ASTRA-ODL Workshop Material

## Getting Help

**In Jupyter notebooks:**

  * `? obj` prints the docstring of the object. Outside of notebooks, `print(obj.__doc__)` does the same.
  * `?? obj` prints the full code of the object (often A LOT of output).
  * `help(obj)` prints help text gathered by Python's built-in help system (docstrings of all attributes, often A LOT of output.

**Online documentation:**

The ODL documentation can be viewed at https://odlgroup.github.io/odl/.
Besides the API documentation, there are also in-depth explanations of some key topics, among others tomographic geometries.
The search bar is your friend.

**ODL examples:**

There are a lot of examples for all kinds of applications in the [examples](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/tree/master/examples) directory of the ODL source.
For the majority of exercises, there exists at least one example that comes close. **However**, you are strongly encouraged not to peek at them immediately.
For learning, it is better to struggle for a bit and ask questions, than to head straight to a solution written by someone else.

**Code:**

After all, the truth lies in the code. To find out how things work under the hood, check out [the code on GitHub](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl).
