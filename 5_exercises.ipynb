    "1. Use the convenience factories to generate all kinds divergent beam geometries.\n",
    "2. Find out which functions are available to query geometry properties. Which one yields points on the \"data manifold\", i.e., locations on the detector during rotation?\n",
    "3. Create a cone beam geometry whose initial source-to-detector vector is $(-4, 0, 0)$ and whose initial detector axes are $(0, 0, -1)$ and $(0, 1, 0)$. What is the handedness of this set of vectors compared to the default one?\n",
    "4. (Bonus) Achieve the same as in 3. with a transformation matrix and the `frommatrix` constructor.\n",
