    "## 1. Create Cone Beam and Helical Geometries\n",
    "\n",
    "Cone beam and helical geometries (divergent beam geometries) require more parameters for their full characterization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the convenience factories to generate all kinds divergent beam geometries.\n",
    "2. Find out which functions are available to query geometry properties. Which one yields points on the \"data manifold\", i.e., locations on the detector during rotation?\n",
    "3. Create a cone beam geometry whose initial source-to-detector vector is $(-4, 0, 0)$ and whose initial detector axes are $(0, 0, -1)$ and $(0, 1, 0)$. What is the handedness of this set of vectors compared to the default one?\n",
    "4. Achieve the same as in 3. with a transformation matrix and the `frommatrix` constructor.\n",
    "5. (Advanced) In a 3D cone beam geometry, make use of the vectorized query functions to generate a `200 \\times 200 \\times 200` volumetric map of distances to the detector for a single source position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Good to Know\n",
    "\n",
    "* `dir(obj)` returns a list of attributes of `obj`.\n",
    "* A vector of all points in a volume can be generated with the `space.points()` function.\n",
    "* More information on NumPy broadcasting can be found in [the corresponding NumPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.broadcasting.html)."

    "- Least-squares methods regularize by *early termination*, i.e., the methods are stopped after $N$ iterations, and this parameter acts as a regularization parameter (larger $N$ means less regularization).\n",
    "- ODL has convenience functionality to perform the splitting. Given a `Geometry` object for the full problem, you can use indexing like `geometry[i:i+5]` or `geometry[1::2]` to extract sub-geometries.\n",
    "- SIRT and SART are Kaczmarz's method in spaces with particular weightings.\n",
    "- To enforce simple constraints like positivity, a projection onto the desired set can be done in each iteration. This runs under the fancy name \"Projection onto Convex Sets\" (POCS), but usually just means to set all negative values to zero."
